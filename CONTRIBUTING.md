# Contributing to LokGeet

Thanks for wanting to help! LokGeet is open-source and community-driven. Please follow these steps:

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a branch for your change.
2. Open a PR with a clear description and a short demo (screenshots or a short GIF).
3. For code changes, include tests or manual verification steps.

## Data & Ethics
- Do not upload private or sensitive recordings without explicit consent.
- Prefer anonymizing performer names unless consented.
- Respect local cultural protocols; if a community asks for material to be removed, comply.

## Adding a new language
- Add transliteration rules or a language pack under `lang_packs/`
- Provide sample audio + ground-truth transcript for unit tests.

## Communication
- Open an issue first if your change is major (new features, infra).
